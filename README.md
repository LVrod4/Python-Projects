## **My thesis to graduate as a Systems Engineer**

To culminate my studies, I developed a program for a primary school to store student information and create some certificates that are usually issued in schools in Venezuela. With this project I obtained the complete note as well as honorable mention and publication.

This project was made using Python, PyQt5 and Flask.
